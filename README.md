# TailwindCSS Workshop

> **NOTE: This workshop is still in the early planning stages.**<br/>Below is a writeup for the outline of the workshop.

This workshop aims to introduce students to the TailwindCSS web framework. TailwindCSS is a utility CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly and efficiently design modern, rich, and responsive websites without ever having to enter an external CSS file. 

TailwindCSS is one of the most popular CSS frameworks, and is used by [many companies](https://tailwindcss.com/showcase) in a wide variety of uses cases and industries. TailwindCSS also integrates seamlessly with other popular and industry-pervasive web frameworks, such as *React*, *Vue*, *Angular*, *Next.js*, *Vite*, and more.

Ultimately, this workshop aims to expose TailwindCSS to UNC Computer Science students, introduce them to CSS utility frameworks and how using such frameworks might enhance their web development skills and workflow, showcase practical usecases for using CSS utility frameworks over vanilla CSS, highlight the importance of UI/UX design for web applications, and ultimately inspire them to use such frameworks to enhance the style and UI/UX of their own web development projects in the future.

*The TailwindCSS workshop is being developed by Ajay Gandecha as part of **COMP 495: Mentored Research** at UNC-Chapel Hill with Professor Kris Jordan. This workshop aims to be part of a larger collection of learning experiences and workshops compiled by the **UNC Computer Science Experience Lab (CSXL)**, which aspires to inform, teach, and potentially further enrich the UNC Computer Science undergraduate student community. We will use these learning experiences to research effective and engaging teaching strategies to each concepts in computer science.*

## Prerequisites and Tools

Students with **basic knowledge of HTML and CSS** would be able to attend this workshop without any difficulty, including students currently enrolled in *COMP 110: Introduction to Programming and Data Science* or higher.

As suggested by Professor Jordan, students will likely use a pre-configured **Repl.it** environment to get started with TailwindCSS and for following along with the workshop. Repl.it will abstract away the setup process from the students, removing a source of friction and frustration with setting up the workshop.

Later on in the workshop, students might be introduced to setting up TailwindCSS in their own projects using VSCode and enabling the VSCode extension.

## Proposed Structure

- Review HTML and CSS (purpose of each)
- Show short example showing the link between HTML and CSS
- Explain the shortcomings of CSS
- Introduce TailwindCSS and how it works
- Open up Repl.it for live demo
- Create small groups of 3 and give them a fun, guided exercise
- Regroup
- Show how to install Tailwind in VS Code + VS Code extension
- Explain the importance of good UI/UX Design
- Closing statements
