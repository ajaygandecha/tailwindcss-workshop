# TailwindCSS Workshop

This workshop aims to introduce students to the TailwindCSS web framework. TailwindCSS is a utility CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly and efficiently design modern, rich, and responsive websites without ever having to enter an external CSS file. 

TailwindCSS is one of the most popular CSS frameworks, and is used by [many companies](https://tailwindcss.com/showcase) in a wide variety of uses cases and industries. TailwindCSS also integrates seamlessly with other popular and industry-pervasive web frameworks, such as *React*, *Vue*, *Angular*, *Next.js*, *Vite*, and more.

Ultimately, this workshop aims to expose TailwindCSS to UNC Computer Science students, introduce them to CSS utility frameworks and how using such frameworks might enhance their web development skills and workflow, showcase practical usecases for using CSS utility frameworks over vanilla CSS, highlight the importance of UI/UX design for web applications, and ultimately inspire them to use such frameworks to enhance the style and UI/UX of their own web development projects in the future.

*Students with **basic knowledge of HTML and CSS** would be able to attend this workshop without any difficulty, including students currently enrolled in *COMP 110: Introduction to Programming and Data Science* or higher.*
