# TailwindCSS Workshop

> **NOTE: This workshop is still in the early planning stages.**<br/>Below is a writeup for the outline of the workshop.

This workshop aims to introduce students to the TailwindCSS web framework. TailwindCSS is a utility CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly and efficiently design modern, rich, and responsive websites without ever having to enter an external CSS file. 

TailwindCSS is one of the most popular CSS frameworks, and is used by [many companies](https://tailwindcss.com/showcase) in a wide variety of uses cases and industries. TailwindCSS also integrates seamlessly with other popular and industry-pervasive web frameworks, such as *React*, *Vue*, *Angular*, *Next.js*, *Vite*, and more.

*This project is being developed by Ajay Gandecha as part of **COMP 495: Mentored Research** at UNC-Chapel Hill with Professor Kris Jordan. This workshop aims to be part of a larger collection of learning experiences and workshops compiled by the **UNC Computer Science Experience Lab (CSXL)**, which aspires to inform, teach, and potentially further enrich the UNC Computer Science undergraduate student community. We will use these learning experiences to research effective and engaging teaching strategies to each concepts in computer science.*
