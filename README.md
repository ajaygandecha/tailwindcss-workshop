# TailwindCSS Workshop

This workshop aims to introduce students to the TailwindCSS web framework. TailwindCSS is a utility CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly and efficiently design modern, rich, and responsive websites without ever having to enter an external CSS file. 

TailwindCSS is one of the most popular CSS frameworks, and is used by [many companies](https://tailwindcss.com/showcase) in a wide variety of uses cases and industries. TailwindCSS also integrates seamlessly with other popular and industry-pervasive web frameworks, such as *React*, *Vue*, *Angular*, *Next.js*, *Vite*, and more.

Ultimately, this workshop aims to expose TailwindCSS to UNC Computer Science students, introduce them to CSS utility frameworks and how using such frameworks might enhance their web development skills and workflow, showcase practical usecases for using CSS utility frameworks over vanilla CSS, highlight the importance of UI/UX design for web applications, and ultimately inspire them to use such frameworks to enhance the style and UI/UX of their own web development projects in the future.

*Students with **basic knowledge of HTML and CSS** would be able to attend this workshop without any difficulty, including students currently enrolled in *COMP 110: Introduction to Programming and Data Science* or higher.*

## Part 0: Setup

1. In order to get started with this workshop, you must have **Visual Studio Code** *(VS Code for short)* IDE installed. If you do not already have VS Code installed, install it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com).

2. Once you have VS Code installed, you want to install the **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** VS Code extension. This extension will enable VS Code's IntelliSense to provide autocomplete and syntax highlighting for TailwindCSS classes. You can find the extension on the Visual Studio Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss). 

    By pressing the green `Install` button, VS Code should open automatically and begin installing the extension. If not, you can install this extension maually within VS Code. Open VS Code and press on the `Extensions` tab on the far left of the window (icon resembling a grid of square puzzle pieces), search for *"Tailwind CSS IntelliSense"*, and install the first option.
    
3. Now that your IDE is installed and set up, the last step is to **clone this repository**. On the *Welcome* tab of VS Code under the *Start* menu, press the `Clone Git Repository...` option.

    From here, a box should appear to type in the URL of the repository. Copy [this link](https://github.com/ajaygandecha/tailwindcss-workshop) into the box and press enter. From here, all of the code in this repository should now show up on your computer!
    
Congratulations! Now that you have completed the setup, it is time to dive into TailwindCSS.
