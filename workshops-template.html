                    Web app stacks are systems that involve front-end development running in the browser and back-end development running on servers. In this workshop you will gain a sense of how to build and connect a full stack application using two of today's leading frameworks for front and backend development: React (Javascript) and FastAPI (Python). You will learn how to begin writing REST APIs, enabling clients to communicate with your server, and also learn how to build front-end components that depend on your server-side APIs. This jam packed workshop is a great jumping-off point for understanding what full-stack software engineering is all about.
